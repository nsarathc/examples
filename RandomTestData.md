# Generating realistic looking Random Test Data #

## Introduction ##

Many unit tests require sample data records containing names, e-mail addresses, or simply text. Inventing a few virtual persons ourselves is fun, but inventing a whole phone book is not.

The Python package, _Faker_, helps us to generate random data for many common and less common fields.
